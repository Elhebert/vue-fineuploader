Makes using [Fine Uploader](http://fineuploader.com) in a VueJS 2 app simple. Drop-in high-level components for a turn-key UI. Use small focused components to build a more custom UI.

# ❗️ This is a work in progress refactor ️️❗️

### The current working version is on the v2 branch which is [right here](https://github.com/FineUploader/vue-fineuploader/tree/v2).

I know I never really finished the v2 and that it's full of bugs. This is why I'm restarting from the ground up. I'm not the developer I was 2 years ago when I made this library and I think that I can now offer something way more powerful that its current state.

### What will change

#### 1. The repo is going to be renamed `vue-fine-uploader` to match the naming convention of FineUploader.

#### 2. Introduction of renderless components to offer full control over the presentation of the different components.

To avoid forcing everyone to switch to renderless components a set of opiniated components will be created.

I'm going to try and make them as accessible as possible.

#### 3. Unit tests.

It had no unit test until now, which made it fairly complicated to debug an issue and tests PRs.

#### Improved documentation with CodeSandbox examples.

I'm going to rewrite the whole documentation and make it user friendlier (is that even a word?) and create CodeSandbox example instead of plain text inside the README.
